# EmbeddedControl
Introductory lab to serial communication using a user defined protocol with an embedded system
The embedded system will be the MSP432 development board, using the Energia (Texas Instruments port of Arduino) C++ software system. The embedded system will provide the PC based system access to GPIO such as analog and digital inputs and outputs as well as servo control.
